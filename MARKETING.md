## 8. Blockers

1. **Google Drive photos** — Blocks all real product content (videos, social posts, site images)
2. **Season Two products in Shopify** — Can't test checkout or generate product showcase content
3. **Voice clip from Mustafa** — Blocks voice clone for branded voiceovers
4. **Real campaign photography** — AI placeholders won't cut it for social credibility
