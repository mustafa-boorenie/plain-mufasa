# PRD.md — PRNTD Website Rebrand & Launch

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Owner:** Mustafa Boorenie
**Target Launch:** March 11, 2026 (29 days out)

## 1. Executive Summary

Full rebrand of PRNTD's Shopify storefront from a rigid template into an immersive, editorial, high-fashion digital experience. The site blends a dark cinematic hero with a clean light editorial body — designer portfolio meets fashion film.

**Core principle:** If it feels like a Shopify theme, redo it.

---

## 3. Design Vision

### 3.1 Site Architecture (Light Editorial + Dark Hero)

The site follows a narrative arc with intentional color transitions:

1. **ARRIVAL** (Hero) — Full-viewport dark immersive hero with dual-layer circular reveal cursor interaction. PRNTD logo top-left, "SHOP" top-right, social icons bottom.
2. **TRANSITION** — 30% height gradient dissolves hero into off-white (#f5f5f3)
3. **DISCOVERY** (Light sections) — Campaign statement, full-bleed editorial, editorial split, product highlights grid, all looks horizontal scroll
4. **MANIFESTO** (Dark punctuation) — Brand manifesto with texture background, white text — the only dark section in the body
5. **ARCHIVE** — Previous collections with horizontal scroll
6. **FOOTER** — Full 4-column footer with newsletter signup

### 3.2 Signature Interaction: Circular Reveal Cursor

Homepage hero features dual-layer image reveal:
- Layer 1: Campaign editorial photo (always visible)
- Layer 2: Revealed through circular spotlight cursor via canvas `source-in` compositing
- Motion echoes on fast movement, background grid, dynamic UI inversion
- 60fps target, pure vanilla JS + rAF (no GSAP)
- Touch support on mobile (tap-and-drag)

### 3.3 Visual Language
- Dark hero → light body (SSENSE/END Clothing aesthetic)
- White product photography backgrounds (intentional, not a bug)
- Generous whitespace, editorial typography
- Playfair Display italic for headlines, Inter 300/400/500 for everything else
- Slow, intentional transitions via IntersectionObserver

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Stack
- **Platform:** Shopify (prntdbybdq.com, auto-deploys from GitHub main)
- **Theme:** Custom Liquid (evolved from Plain Jane 2.0 base)
- **Animation:** Pure vanilla JS + rAF + IntersectionObserver (no GSAP)
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Playfair Display 400/600/italic, Inter 300/400/500)
- **Build:** No build step — pure Shopify Liquid + vanilla JS

### 5.2 File Map
```
layout/
  theme.liquid          — Routes index/collection/product/page to custom templates, others to old layout

templates/
  index.liquid          — Full editorial homepage with hero interaction
  collection.liquid     — Light editorial product grid
  product.liquid        — Split-layout PDP with AJAX cart + JSON-LD structured data
  cart.liquid           — Redirects to /collections/all (cart drawer handles cart)
  page.about.liquid     — Street-luxury About page (Hatton Labs style)
  page.shipping.liquid  — Shipping & Returns policy page
  page.contact.liquid   — Contact form page
  page.lookbook.liquid  — Brutalist lookbook (Stussy style, broken masonry grid)

assets/
  rebrand.css           — Full design system (1500+ lines)
  hero-interaction.js   — Dual-layer circular reveal with source-in compositing
  scroll-animations.js  — IntersectionObserver fade-in animations
  product-page.js       — Gallery, variants, AJAX add-to-cart, accordions
  cart-drawer.js        — Slide-out AJAX cart drawer (loaded on all rebranded pages)
  campaign-editorial-01.png      — AI portrait (tatriz hoodie model)
  campaign-editorial-wide-01.png — AI landscape (desert scene)
  campaign-texture-01.png        — AI texture (embroidered fabric close-up)

snippets/
  header-index.liquid   — Homepage header (logo + shop + socials)
  __default-head.liquid — Shared head (fonts, CSS, meta)
  __default-template.liquid — Old theme wrapper (bypassed on rebranded pages)
```

### 5.3 Key Technical Decisions
- `source-in` canvas compositing for hero reveal (v1 multiply/destination-out was broken)
- `product.json` deleted → `product.liquid` for full template control
- Font override with `!important` on all `.pdp-editorial` elements (old theme Inconsolata bleeds through body)
- `object-fit: contain` on product images (white-bg photos need centering, not cropping)
- Cart page redirect + drawer instead of cart template (better UX, no reload)
- Klaviyo blocked via CSS (not JS route blocking) for production safety

### 5.4 Shopify Logo Settings
- `enter_screen_logo` → Homepage + footer
- `collection_screen_logo` → Collection header
- `product_screen_logo` → PDP header

## 7. Blocked / Needs Input from Mustafa

1. **Season Two product photography** — Do you have editorial shots, or just tech pack flats?
2. **Season Two pricing** — What's the price range?
3. **Season Two products in Shopify** — Are they created in admin yet, or need setup?
4. **Google Drive folder** — For raw video clips (voice clone + content pipeline)
5. **Campaign photoshoot** — Any planned? Even phone shots in good lighting would upgrade the site massively
6. **Shipping details** — Rates, processing time, carrier, international?
7. **Return policy** — Timeframe, conditions, process?
8. **Email marketing** — Using Klaviyo? Mailchimp? Something else?
9. **Social accounts** — Instagram handle? TikTok? (X is @mustafaboorenie)
10. **Budget for ads** — Any paid social planned for launch?

## 8. Success Criteria

- [ ] Hero interaction feels "expensive and intentional"
- [ ] No element feels like a Shopify template
- [ ] 60fps on hero interactions
- [ ] < 3s page load
- [ ] Mobile experience is premium (not a degraded desktop)
- [ ] Complete purchase flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Season Two products live and purchasable on March 11
- [ ] At least 100 email subscribers before launch
- [ ] Social media content running 2 weeks before launch
- [ ] Mustafa says "this is fire" 🔥

---

## 9. Lessons Learned

1. **Canvas compositing:** v1's destination-out + multiply couldn't reveal Layer 2. source-in is the correct approach.
2. **Old theme font bleed:** Inconsolata on body requires nuclear `!important` overrides on all rebranded elements.
3. **Mobile grids:** Always keep 2-column on mobile for fashion e-commerce. Single column makes products look sparse.
4. **object-fit contain vs cover:** White-background product photos need `contain` to avoid cropping. `cover` works for editorial/campaign shots.
5. **Klaviyo popup:** Blocks entire site — suppress with CSS, not just JS route blocking.
6. **Git push timeouts:** GitHub API (blob → tree → commit → update ref) is a reliable fallback when HTTPS push hangs.
7. **Shopify deploys:** ~30-60 seconds from GitHub push to live. Can verify via Playwright before telling user to refresh.
8. **Playfair Display italic for product names:** Looks wrong at small sizes on commerce pages. Inter is better for product info. Reserve Playfair for editorial headlines only.
